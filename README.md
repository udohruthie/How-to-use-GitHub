# How-to-use-GitHub
In this repo, I am using Github as a beginner.
I have been on Github for a while,but i have never really had the time to create my wn stuf.
I used it for other projects and bootcamps only.
Now, I want to start creating, sharing and storing my own code creations, and I realize
that I must now understand my Github deeply, so I can use it better.
so here we go.
This cod have been a code script but I choose to make it a text script to show that 
any thing can go here.
